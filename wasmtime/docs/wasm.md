# Writing WebAssembly

Wasmtime is a runtime for *executing* WebAssembly but you also at some point
need to actually produce the WebAssembly module to feed into Wasmtime! This
section of the guide is intended to provide some introductory documentation for
compiling source code to WebAssembly to later run in Wasmtime. There's plenty of
other documentation on the web for doing this, so you'll want to be sure to
check out your language's documentation for WebAssembly as well.

* [Rust](wasm-rust.md)
* [C/C++](wasm-c.md)
* [AssemblyScript](wasm-assemblyscript.md)
* [WebAssembly Text Format (`*.wat`)](wasm-wat.md)
