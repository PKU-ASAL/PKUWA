# Using WebAssembly from your Language

Wasmtime can be used as a library to embed WebAssembly execution support
within applications. Wasmtime is written in Rust, but bindings are available
through a C API for a number of other languages too:

* [Rust](lang-rust.md)
* [C](lang-c.md)
* [Python](lang-python.md)
* [.NET](lang-dotnet.md)
* [Go](lang-go.md)
* [Bash](lang-bash.md)
